# Image Scrapper and Downloader

I am working on javaScript memeory-card game for which I need many images
whihc I cannot download manually. So, I made a script which will scrape all the images's src links and its alt text and then download all the images in the current folder.


- **Note:** Won't for work other website. Due to differnet html layout
