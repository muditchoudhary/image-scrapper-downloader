# Image Scrapper and Downloader

I am working on a JavaScript memory-card game for which I need many images
which I cannot download manually. So, I made a script that will scrape all the images' src links and their alt text and then download all the images in the current folder.


- **Note:** Won't for work another website. Due to differnet html layout
